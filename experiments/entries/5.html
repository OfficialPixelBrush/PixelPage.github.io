<h2>7-Segment Decoder ROM</h2>
This idea originally came from me wanting to build a fully digital clock from TTL-Chips and Diodes.

Here's the Logisim circuit for that.
To not need 4 separate decoding ROMs, I figured just using 4 Registers would work instead. Later I realized just flashing the 4 numbers quickly would work too.
<h2> Soldering time </h2>
Either way, only one half of the ROM was ever soldered.
