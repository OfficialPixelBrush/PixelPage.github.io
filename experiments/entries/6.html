<h2>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: The Adventures of Pixel and Kyle</h2>
(or later Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: The Adventures of Team Stride)
was a Webcomic I started working on in 2017.

<h3>The initial inspiration</h3>
I first discovered Pokémon Mystery Dungeon as a whole from accidentally finding a PMD:RAD Comic Dub on YouTube.
I binge watched it from beginning to end, eventually arriving at the end of the Dub. Hungry for content, I decided to find out where the comic came from which lead me to SmackJeeves.

<h3>SmackJeeves</h3>
SmackJeeves was an interesting website, with wonderful comics (from what I had heard). At last, most of the comics there didn't interest me. I was hungry for PMD: RAD.
<br><br>
I eventually finished PMD:RAD, but was still hungry for more, so I decided to read PMD: Victory Fire, which was also incredible.
<br>
By this point, I realized "Hey, I do art. Couldn't I make a comic as well?".
<br><br>
So I decided to hit up a then friend of mine, and asked him if we could Roleplay. That's right. The whole of PMD:TAoPaK/PMD:ATS was just a picture version of a roleplay between two moronic teenagers, both of which had never played a PMD game.
<br><br>
<h3>The "Writing" Process</h3>
After the first "Chapter" was finished after a session that lasted a few hours, it was time to turn it into a Comic. This began with selecting all the relevant messages, and copy-pasting them into WordPad, removing timestamps and usernames to get a clean-ish script.
<h3>Motivation and Friendships are hard</h3>
Finally, it was time to draw. The first few pages came out decently easily, but as the pages progressed, my motivation waned and my schedule slowed.
<br>
My Artstyle began to visibly change between each page as I tried to find ways to simplify making pages and was trying new things behind the scenes.
<br>
At one point I procrastinated a page until literally the last few minutes before midnight (Page 19).
<br><br>
Around this time this friend and I had a large falling out, deciding to part ways for good. This meant I could no longer write with one of the <i>protagonists</i> of my comic.
<br>
Shit.
<br><br>
As a result, I got desperate, and started trying to write him out... <i>in the first Chapter.</i>
<br>
This is why Kyle disappears around Page 20. This is why he leaves a note.
<h3>So where did Kyle go?</h3>
In Universe, I had come up with some vague idea that he was actually the chosen one, and Pixel was simply collateral that came along by accident. Kyle was to be trained by the gods, while Pixel was to stay behind and just enjoy his new life as a Pokémon.
<br>
Yeah. I was very desperate.
<br><br>
As for the real guy, I don't know what he's up to these days. Last I checked in on him he was selling stickers.
<h3>A revival</h3>
After deciding that this wasn't working in late 2017, I decided to reboot the series. This is what became <b>Adventures of Team Stride</b>.
<br>
The main cast this time around consisted of me and my girlfriend at the time.
<br>
This went similarly well, and a lot of stuff had to be shelved once again.
<br><br>
As a result, I decided to just have Pixel be the main star. But instead of doing a Comic, I decided to think bigger. I wanted to have it be an animated cartoon or movie.
<br>
Surprisingly, this idea went quite far. A lot of the people whom were fans of my original comic decided to join in and participate (completely unpaid, of course).

Unfortunately, after another round of falling outs and simply this project being way too huge to take on without any experience or budget, I decided to shelve it indefinitely once again.

<h3>Epilogue</h3>
I tried to at least finish the original chapter for PMD: The Adventures of Pixel and Kyle a few years back, only adding 3 more pages.
<br><br>
I don't know if I'll ever revive this project as the chances for that are basically non-existent.
<br>
Though I do plan to update this entry with some images and other content later down the line. Look forward to that.
