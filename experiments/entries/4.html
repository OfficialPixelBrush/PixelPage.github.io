<h3> The Commodore 64 </h3>
I eventually decided it'd be funny to make a version in Commodore BASIC, since I had the original manual to use for reference.
I had a version written in C to compare against, <a href="https://github.com/OfficialPixelBrush/RayM">RayM</a>, to make sure it all looked like it should.

I'd've been wanting to learn Shader Programming and Godot for a long while. As a result, I started reimplementing the same Algorithm in Godot.

This became <a href="https://github.com/OfficialPixelBrush/RayMGoDot">RayMGodot</a>.
