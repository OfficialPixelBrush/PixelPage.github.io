<h2>DIY Animation Cels</h2>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
I always wanted to make my own custom 2D Animations but just doing them on paper wasn't enough for me.

<h3>The Right Materials</h3>
Simply due to being cheap, I decided to go with overhead projector transparencies which are cheaply available from Amazon or any office supply store.

<h3>The Right Tools</h3>
Turns out you can get a simple hole punch on Amazon that has the perfect shape as an ACME Peg bar! Just look for "visitor badge hole-punch" or something along those lines.

<h3>Initial Experiments</h3>

Once all those had arrived, and I was able to confirm that my punches lined up, it was a matter of figuring out what sort of ink would be most appropriate for this medium.

The most ideal ink turned out to be Acrylic paint. It stuck the best, was the most smudge and scratch resistant, and it resulted in a nice, deep black.
