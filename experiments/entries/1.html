<h2>DIY Animation Cels</h2>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
I always wanted to make my own custom 2D Animations but just doing them on paper wasn't enough for me.

<h3>The Right Materials</h3>
Simply due to being cheap, I decided to go with overhead projector transparencies which are cheaply available from Amazon or any office supply store. The only negative these have is that they're A4 instead of whatever size Animation Paper is, but it's close enough.

<h3>The Right Tools</h3>
Turns out you can get a simple hole punch on Amazon that has the perfect shape as an ACME Peg bar! Just look for "visitor badge hole-punch" or something along those lines.

<h3>Initial Experiments</h3>

Once all those had arrived, and I was able to confirm that my punches lined up, it was a matter of figuring out what sort of ink would be most appropriate for this medium.

The most ideal ink turned out to be Acrylic paint. It stuck the best, was the most smudge and scratch resistant, and it resulted in a nice, deep black.

Next up was color

Yep. That's it. A red sphere on my DIY Animation Cel. This will work.

<h3>Let's draw a character!</h3>
I went to work right away, having already sketched out a little walk cycle beforehand on Animation Paper.

It was here that I noticed a major issue.
<br>
Acrlyic paint, as it is, was quite globby. It likes to stick and bunch together.
<br>
So I started looking into it, and found out you can dilute Acrylics with water. I did a test run, figuring it wouldn't work due to the plastic sheets being quite hydrophobic.

...huh, well, nevermind. That just worked.
<br>
I guess lets color it in and see how it looks.

And there we have it! My first properly colored Cel!

<h3>Other cels</h3>
I've made a few more Cels since then.

Here we have the step-by-step creation process of a birthday gift for a friend.

This has been my post on DIY Animation Cels. Lets hope I make good use of this knowledge someday!
