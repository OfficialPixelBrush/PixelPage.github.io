<h2>DIY Silicon Carbide</h2>
I've always been a fan of semiconductors. They're cool. They make modern techonology possible.
<br>
Eventually, the question arose: Could I make my own transistors or diodes? The answer is maybe!

<h3>Initial Research</h3>
Initially I was quite sceptical myself. However, reading about how <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode#Point-contact_diodes">Point-contact diodes</a> were made back in the day, it gave me hope.
<br>
Additionally, consulting the most advanced AI I knew of at the time, Google Gemini (which advised me not to try due to the high temperatures), I figured out what I'd need to make it work.
<br><br>
<li>A source of carbon</li>
<li>A source of silicon dioxide</li>
<li>Lots of heat</li>
<br>
Thus, my plan was to just stick a pencil lead in some sand and use the resisitve heat of carbon to heat it up.

<h3>First experiments</h3>
My initial attempts were... bad to put it lightly. The sand I used had been extracted from dirt. The carbon rods were pencil leads.

Potential success?
<img src="/images/experiments/0002/IMG_8952.jpg">
Probably not.

New setup! Lets hope this changes something!
<img src="/images/experiments/0002/IMG_8958.jpg">
Yeah, no...
<br>
Overall, the more I tried, the less it worked, so I reconsidered my approach.

<h3>The Acheson process</h3>
As it turned out, what I was doing had already been discovered and was the primary way to make Silicon Carbide! This process is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acheson_process">Acheson process</a>.
<br>
The Acheson process is quite simple, in theory. You take a metal bucket, you put sand in it, put a graphite rod into it, then connect power to both ends of it to generate heat. Get that whole mixture up to around 2000Â°C, and you're making SiC.
<br>
The detail that the Acheson process wikipedia page added was pre-mixing some Carbon into the Silcion Dioxide to improve the chances of the two element reacting.


<h3>Another round</h3>
Another round of experiments. This time, I decided to buy some actual materials.

This time, I was equipped with a bucket I got from a hardware store, and some bird sand.
<br>

Even these experiments proved unfruitful. I even tried to use my DIY Power supply, which can pump out more Voltage but the lack of Amps hurt its performance.
<br>
By this point I just started trying whatever I thought may work. I had known about carbon arc lamps before this point, and figured just poking two severed carbon rods may make enough heat to form SiC.

After some trial and error, I got this. According to a chart I found online, dark and light green indicate a decent purity.
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
            Degree of purity (in %)
        </th>
        <th>
            Color
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            99.8
        </td>
        <td>
            light green
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            99.5
        </td>
        <td>
            dark green
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            99
        </td>
        <td>
            black
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            < 99
        </td>
        <td>
            gray
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
Whether this chart can be trusted remains to be seen, as I never managed to connect this miniscule piece in any way to test it. Try connecting a cheap Amazon multimeter to essentially a grain of sand!
<h3>So now what?</h3>
I have plans to eventually experiment some more. I even bought myself a Power supply that can output more Amps (but only 750mV). So who knows.
