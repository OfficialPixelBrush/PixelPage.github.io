Chapter 2
Pixel woke up with a rather stiff neck. The hard, wet and fairly cold floor wasn't the most comfortable thing to sleep on.
Kyle was still asleep on Pixel's fluffy body, pixel sighed as he couldn't move away.
as pixels eyes adjusted to the daylight and he got a grip of himself he saw a figure standing by their hollow make-shift nest, blocking part of the sun Kyle? Is that you?

Hugs you tighter,mumbling with his eyes sleepily shut Im right here man

Pixel looked at Kyle "Wait. Then... who's that?"
Pixels ears folded backwards out of worry.

The figure was standing in a predator-like stance, like how a cat would be before pouncing. The eyes of the figure glowed bright in the slight shade cast by the trees, the red colour glow piercing right through them.

"Who's..." Kyle, who Stretches upwards, locking his eyes on the demonic figure staring at them making his blood turn cold "P- Pix we gotta go..." Kyle stumbles backwards.

(P) "Yeah... agreed."
Pixel leaps out of the hole, halting only for a second looking where to go.
(P) "WERE SHOULD WE RUN?!"

The figure stepped forward, some growling beginning to be heard.

(K) "BACK TO THE SAFE FOREST!" 

(P) "Yes! We can throw them off that way!"
Pixel runs straight into the forest, in the general direction of the waterfall.

Feels the adrenaline surge through him as he bolts off following Pixel, occasionally looking back at red eyes that appeared to follow them.
"ARE WE NEARLY THERE?"

The eyes were no longer seen behind them.

Pixel spots a bit of hollow space behind the waterfall "Kyle! There! We can hide back there!"

"Ahhh ok! If you're sure!" Kyle hops and squeezes himself tightly into the small space, shivering a little.
Pixel follows Kyle into the small space, not having much of an issue as he is smaller than kyle

"Shh! Be quiet!" Kyle holds his breath "I-is it still there?"

The Creature stepped into the light, revealing the proper shape and species. They were an Absol. Seeing no-one around, they stepped near the water and started to drink the water, their eyes closing.

Pixel was shivering, he held onto Kyle's left paw, to slightly comfort himself.
The Duo observed the Absol carefully through the crevice they were hiding in.

The Absol's ear twitched, but she kept drinking.
The duo watched cautiously.
Pixel attempted to peek out a bit more, before Kyle pulled him back a bit.

The Absol just looked up, and stared into the Waterfall at them as she laid down on her stomach.

The duo continued observing the Absol.
She just blinked, just watching them as she seemingly knew they were in there.
Pixel and Kyle looked at each other.
(P) “Are they not dangerous...?” Pixel asked Kyle.
(K) “I mean... I guess they’re not?”

She yawned and laid her head down.
Pixel jumped out of the curb.

She quickly raised her head and looked at Pixel.
(Q) "..."

Pixel gathered up some confidence.
(P) “H- hello?”
She just stared, watching him.

Pixel hesitated. Kyle watched him closely.
(P) “Uhm... c- can you talk?”

She huffed softly.
(Q) "You can...?"
Pixel seemed surprised. (P) “Y- yeah! What’s your name?“
(Q) "Qira."
(P) “Qira? That’s a... interesting name?”
Pixel stuttered a bit, still being slightly terrified of her.
Kyle decided to climb out of his hiding spot to join Pixel.
(Q)  "Is it weird?"
(P) “No no! It’s just... well... you’re a Pokémon! Those usually don’t talk! Or are real for that matter...”
Qira AseteToday at 02:12
"You two new here?"
Pixel BrushToday at 02:14
Pixel looked at Kyle.
(K) “We... I mean...”
Kyle looked over to Pixel for guidance, he didn’t know what to say either.
(K) “I suppose you could say that...?”
Qira AseteToday at 02:15
"Cool."
Pixel BrushToday at 02:16
(K) “Qira. Qira? Is that correct? My name is Kyle. This is my pal Pixel.”
Qira AseteToday at 02:18
"Nice to meet you both. So I see you're an Eevee and Riolu?"
Pixel BrushToday at 02:20
Pixel stepped forward.
“We are actually-“
Kyle closed Pixels muzzle.
He whispered into his ears.
(k) “Psh. Pal. Not yet. We should get to know these people- pokémon before we say anything about us being human.”

Pixel looked at Kyle.
Pixel sighed, understanding Kyle’s reasoning.
“We are... those things- Pokémon! Eevee and Riolu! Mhm!”
It was easy to tell Pixel was lying.
Qira AseteToday at 02:21
"Both of you were human, and then transported here by some sort of powerful being, hm?"
Pixel BrushToday at 02:22
Both were dumbfounded.

Kyle awkwardly pushed out a couple words.
(K) “How did you-?”
Qira AseteToday at 02:23
"Same case. And you're pretty bad at lying. Or whispering for that matter."
Pixel BrushToday at 02:23
Pixel sprung up.
“You’re a Human too?!”

Thousands of questions were filling his mind.
Qira AseteToday at 02:24
"I was."
Pixel BrushToday at 02:26
(K) “Do you remember how you got here?”
“All we know is that we were in some bright void with some voice...”
The duo decided to get closer to Qira and sit down next to her by the lake.
Qira AseteToday at 02:29
"Barely. It's been years since I first got here, so my memory is faint."
Pixel BrushToday at 02:30
(K) “... how long...?”
Qira AseteToday at 02:30
"I don't remember exactly when. I lost track of time."
Pixel BrushToday at 02:30
(K) “Oh...”
Qira AseteToday at 02:31
"Mhm."
Pixel BrushToday at 02:32
Pixel thought for a moment, then remembered the town he spotted the day before.
“Uhm... I saw a town yesterday! Mind guiding us there...?”
(K) “We’re hoping to get some proper shelter there at the very least.”
Qira AseteToday at 02:35
"Sure."
She stood up.
Pixel BrushToday at 02:35
The two relatively small Pokémon followed as quickly as they could.
Pixel BrushToday at 02:43
(I’ll be heading to bed, later pal!)
Qira AseteToday at 02:45
(See ya.)
Pixel BrushToday at 10:10
(And i’m back.)
Pixel BrushToday at 11:49
(Alrighty, we can continue ^^)
Qira AseteToday at 11:50
(Yeah I'm here too.)
Pixel BrushToday at 11:50
(Awesome.)
Qira AseteToday at 11:50
Qira walked down the forest, toward the village.
Pixel BrushToday at 11:52
The two Pokémon followed.

Pixel pulled on a bit of Qiras Hair, trying to get her attention.
"Are any dangerous Pokémon around here?"
(K) "We don't know any moves, so we're practically defenseless..."
"And you can't protect us the entire time and guide us everywhere..."
Qira AseteToday at 11:55
She looked at Pixel, a bit of a pissed look on her face.
"Don't pull my hair."
Pixel BrushToday at 11:56
Pixel was slightly embarrassed.
"S- sorry."
"The question still stands."
Qira AseteToday at 11:57
"Well no, not really. Not around these parts at least."
Pixel BrushToday at 11:59
Pixel still wasn't entirely relieved of his fear. Something was there, he just didn't know what.

Kyle tried to make the best of it and tried to stay calm.
Qira AseteToday at 11:59
"If you're feeling anxious, I am actually one of those dangerous pokemon."
Pixel BrushToday at 12:00
"W- what do you mean?"
Qira AseteToday at 12:00
"Other Pokemon tend to fear me."
Pixel BrushToday at 12:01
"I suppose that makes sense... heck. Absol, the Disaster Pokémon."
Qira AseteToday at 12:03
"I'm supposed to be in the mountains, you might be thinking."
Pixel BrushToday at 12:04
"Not necessarily... just... uh..."
Pixel felt like he insulted Qira.
Qira AseteToday at 12:17
"It's okay.'
Pixel BrushToday at 12:18
(K) "But again, do you know any attacks you could teach us? At least something so we could defend ourselves."
Qira AseteToday at 12:19
"Later."
She kept walking to the village.
Pixel BrushToday at 12:19
Eventually the trio arrived.
Qira AseteToday at 12:20
"Here we are."
(I like to think Qira is able to change between mega absol and normal at will, but almost always stays normal.)
Pixel BrushToday at 12:21
(Sounds good, she could just be hiding the stone in her hair or something.)
Qira AseteToday at 12:21
(Yeah something like that.)
Pixel BrushToday at 12:26
(boom, idea for the town)

(the circle is a marketplace)
Qira AseteToday at 12:26
Oooh nice.)
Pixel BrushToday at 12:26
(The lines inside the border are streets.)
Qira AseteToday at 12:27
(understandable)
Pixel BrushToday at 12:27
(Awesome! Any name ideas?)
Qira AseteToday at 12:27
(Nope!)
Pixel BrushToday at 12:29

(Alright, it doesn't have to be too creative. That's good.)
(Woodland Town?)
Qira AseteToday at 12:30
(Sure?)
Pixel BrushToday at 12:30
(since it's very close to the forest, possibly known for their forestry and wooden contruction)
Qira AseteToday at 12:30
(I like it.)
Pixel BrushToday at 12:31
(Awesome.)
(Let's continue then. P.S. There is a sign that reads "Woodland Town", in a kind of Pokémon Specific Font)
Qira AseteToday at 12:33
(Okay.)
Pixel BrushToday at 12:33
(Alrighty.)
(Let’s continue.)
Qira AseteToday at 12:34
She walked into the village, staying silent.
Pixel BrushToday at 12:35
The market was filled with Pokémon, Chatting, Buying, Selling, Trading, etc.
Qira AseteToday at 12:36
"So, this is the village."
Pixel BrushToday at 12:44
The duo seemed slightly anxious seeing so many Pokémon talking.
