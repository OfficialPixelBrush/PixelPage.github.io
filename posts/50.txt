</br>
Been a while!
</br>
I've been incredibly busy with both work and my new YouTube Channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Ms3z2ZgfbdjImNgWff0iw">80Bytes</a>.
</br>

</br>
My main project on there, at the moment, is building a Z80-based Computer entirely from scratch, and with only limited electrical know-how!
</br>

</br>
There's a good chunk of Documentation for it on my GitHub,</br>
just check the <a href="https://github.com/OfficialPixelBrush/Pix80">Pix80 Repository</a> there.
</br>

</br>

</br>

</br>
I've been developing an Emulator for the Project as well, though it is still very WIP.
