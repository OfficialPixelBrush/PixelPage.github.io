</br>
Did a complete overhaul of all the pages in the Creations section.
</br>

</br>
This update has been long overdue, and extremely necessary.
</br>

</br>
The pages were inconsistent and terribly formatted.
</br>
Not to mention that using tables for everything was unmaintainable as hell.
</br>
This has all been resolved, as we're using much more modern flexboxes now.
</br>

</br>
This also brings this page a smidge closer to actually being usable on mobile!
</br>

</br>
In general, this site has needed a revamp for ages, and now I've finally made a good start on that. It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing for a website with about 7 years of developmental baggage.
</br>

</br>
Outside of that, my last exam for my apprenticeship is coming up on the 24th.
</br>
That'll be fun.
</br>

</br>
See y'all again some other time!
</br>
