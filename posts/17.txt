This Post right here was created using a new utility so I don't have to manually update all the post messages when I want to add one.

If any of you want to use this rather rudementary tool yourselves, check out the <a href="https://github.com/OfficialPixelBrush/officialpixelbrush.github.io">GitHub Page</a>.
