</br>
Majorly overhauled a lot of the CSS, namely the fact that now there's a transparent background behind a lot of the hoverable images to increase the visiblity in front of said image.
</br>

</br>
Also removed a bit of depth from the posts to make them look a little less intrusive. 
</br>

</br>
Made some elements look more in line with the rest of the Website, mainly buttons and embeds.
</br>

</br>
Let's hope this'll improve the overall usability and appeal of the website.
