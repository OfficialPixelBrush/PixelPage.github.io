I've created another tool, which is also available on the <a href="https://github.com/OfficialPixelBrush/officialpixelbrush.github.io">GitHub Page</a> that is used to update the time whenever a new commit happens.
</br>
Unfortunately I have no idea how to do this automatically yet, since GitHub's Javascript API apparently can't easily do that.
</br>

</br>
I am however quite glad that these tools will make keeping this website up to date qutie a bit easier. Have a pointless button.
