Introducing the Website's new Style!
</br>

</br>
<h1>dark.css</h1>
</br>
(version 2, i guess)
</br>

</br>
It's... very synthwavey...
</br>

</br>

</br>
I may add other themes as time goes on but for now it'll just be this. 
</br>
The old, legacy theme will be viewable via this button
</br>

</br>
<button onclick="swapStyleSheet("../css/darkLegacy.css")">90s mode</button>
</br>

</br>
will become more and more broken as time goes on. 
</br>
It will not be updated in the near future.
</br>

</br>
However, I'm considering adding a "orange" option, for those that prefered the old color scheme.
