Currently experimenting with some new Post Layouts, mostly to make it so some of them don't take up half the screen. 
</br>

</br>
I've already updated <a href="webpages">WebPages</a> to test this, and I'm rather happy with the result, expect me to add more images to things (prolly JPEGs to avoid loading thousands of uncompressed PNG images), alongside a more easily navigatable site in general.

I'll also be trying to cut down the Navbar elements and reorganize them slightly, all in the name of being more pleasant to look at and easier to navigate.
