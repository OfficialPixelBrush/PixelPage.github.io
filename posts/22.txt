Introducing the <a href="images.html">Images</a> Page!

At the moment it only contains my Late 2018 to Early 2019 Sketchbook which is at the very least somewhat noteworthy.

Been meaning to scan it for quite a while because it's just deteriorating more and more by the day, so I finally got around to scanning it!
