</br>
My new Comic,
</br>
<h1>Kangaskan's Life</h1>
</br>
is officially out!
</br>

</br>
The first page at least, check it out on here on it's own Page, located by going to my Webpages Section, then clicking <a href="/kangaskhanslife">Kangaskhan's Life</a>!
</br>

</br>
More pages will hopefully follow soon, though I'm rather busy with school!
</br>
